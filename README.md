# Coldloop.exe

**Coldloop.exe** is a standalone 2D hack-and-slash demo created in Godot 4. It explores atmospheric gameplay, visual storytelling, and minimalist design principles â€” all through the lens of a survival-based combat experience.

This project serves as both a personal technical demo and a narrative experiment for larger, ongoing work. All assets and systems are original and designed for modularity, expansion, and reuse.
